# An AI based System for Pronunciation Assessment and Tracking of Speech Fluency Variations

Pronunciation assessment is crucial for non-native speakers learning a new language. Beyond traditional communication tasks, speech-driven electronic devices powered by AI are increasingly pervasive, presenting both opportunities and challenges for accurate speech recognition and analysis. We propose an artificial intelligence (AI) based pronunciation assessment system that records, transcribes, and evaluates user utterances using speech quality indicators such as word error rate (WER) , words per second (WPS),character error rate (CER) and pace identification.

Along with these i have also implemented the Grammar correction feature, Youtube video transcription, translation and summarization features as well. 

For Security purpose i have implemented the authentiction which is voice based using Mel Frequenct Cepstral Coefficients (MFFC's)
